    </p>

	<p>
		This is Scrum Scrum City's Assignment 1.  Here we created a fantastic, HTML5 certified, webpage 
		detailing how one can craft a scrumptios pie. In designing this webpage we utilize CSS in order to create a sleek, 
		good looking, functional website.  We include a pie recipe that has been passed down from Scrum Master to Scrum 
		Master over many generations, because we are "hip" and "happenin" and definitely "<em>so</em> not a relic of a bygone era"
		we included a helpful video of making our pie in place of a lame picture, and even user reviews of our pie.

		Gabe wrote the HTML5 certified HTML and CSS in ScrumPie.html and pie.CSS.  For extra credit, Merrill created our scrum's own Apache local 
		server from his own computer and Chris attempted to get an apache server running on his phone but was unable to, Charlie really sold the pie 
		and Gabe embedded a video.  Chris also helped with the CSS.  Charlie wrote the readme in this index.html file and linked it to the Scrum's main 
		index.
