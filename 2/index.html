    </p>

   <p>
	  This is Scrum Scrum City's Assignment 2.  Here we created the "Rancid Tomatoes" website.  This website is designed to be a conglomeration of 
	  reviews for the movie TMNT, moddeled after an older version of the Rotten Tomatoes site.  Rancid Tomatoes is in no way, shape, form, or color 
	  associated with Rotten Tomatoes.  Please don't sue us.
   </p>

   <p>
	 Chris headed the writing of the CSS (and necessary edits to the html) with some contribution from Charlie.  Chris did the man part of assignment 2.	
	 Charlie wrote the custom reviews, made the celebrity names link to the real rotten tomatoes site, and created the index.html file which you are 
	 currently seeing.  The html skeleton for the main page was provided by NAT.
