	<p>
	  This is our Assignment 4. Here we made an html page that uses Javascript to animate asciimations.

	</p>

<p>
	The majority of the Javascript and all other code was done by Gabe with some help from Merrill the Deserter.    
	Including the extra credit of a turbo button, control enabling, pause and backwards playing, creative custom animation and google closure by Gabe.
	(Google closure resulted in a 19.5% or 1.277 kilobyte reduction in size)
	Charlie wrote the index.html and readme.
