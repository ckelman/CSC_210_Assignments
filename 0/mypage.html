    <h2> Essay on the Dying Web: </h2>
    <p>
	The Web is not dying. While apps are certainly becoming the mainstream way to interact with the Internet, accessing the web through a browser is too valuable a resource to die out. Other revolutionary technologies, such as the telephone communication, have lasted many years in the face of other emergent technologies. Granted, hardwire telephones are being phased out, but only because they offer no real advantage over something like a cell phone. Whereas browser usage still has many advantages over apps. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
	The old web may very well dwindle to a more niche usage, but those who can use browsers to their full capabilities will continue to use it. Personally, I could not imagine using only apps in my day-to-day life. Apps are certainly convenient, but they simply dont come close to offering the functionality of a browser. The average person does not need all this functionality, however, which has led to the rise of apps that we have seen. The user-friendliness of apps, along with their convenience, could be likened to the explosion of popularity of Apple products as a whole. The OS X operating system is much more user friendly than Windows, which is exactly what an average consumer wants, even if that means paying more money. Still, there will always be those who stand by Windows, in spite of its shortcomings. This, in my opinion, will be the fate of the web browser as well.

		IZ A JOKE!!!!!!
	</h2>

	<p>
		There are 3 Spies that get captured. One spy is French, one is German and the other is Italian. Their captors come into the cell and grab the French spy and tie his hands behind a chair in the next room. They torture him for 2 hours before he answers all questions and gives up all of his secrets. The captors throw the French spy back into the cell and grab the German spy. They tie his hands behind the chair as well and torture him for 4 hours before he tells them what they want to know. They throw him back into the cell and grab the Italian spy. They tie his hands behind the chair and begin torturing. 4 hours go by and the spy isn't talking. Then 8 hours, then 16 and after 24 hours they give up and throw him back into the cell. The German and French spy are impressed and ask him how he managed to not talk. The Italian spy responds, " I wanted to!, but I couldn't move my hands!".
