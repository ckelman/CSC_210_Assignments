	We made our server and created our first few HTML pages.
	We added all the bells and whistles, including a group bio, a joke, an essay and javascript text-box which can perform a word count. Additionally, we worked meticulously to make the website as ugly as possible in the style of the 1995 myspace, even though regrettably we couldn't get chrome to support blinking text. (The smiley banner is clickable).

	As a group we worked on making the website. After the lab time was over, Merrill and Absinthe finished the site. Gabe made the css for the myspace appearance of the website and the javascript for the word counter. Charlie did many of the whistles, such as the joke and bio. Chris wrote the essay.
